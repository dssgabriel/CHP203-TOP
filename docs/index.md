# Introduction

This site contains courses and practical work for the course **CHP203: Parallel Optimization Techniques** offered by Hugo Taboada and Gabriel Dos Santos as part of the [High Performance Computing & Simulation](https://chps.uvsq.fr/) M.Sc. program at [ISTY/UVSQ](https://www.uvsq.fr/institut-des-sciences-et-techniques-des-yvelines-isty). Its use is reserved for students of the [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

The Spring 2025 session will start on Tuesday, 25 March and end on Wednesday, 30 April.

## Course Information

### Description & objectives

This course provides an overview of common optimization techniques for modern HPC architectures, as well as giving an introduction to supercomputing tools and environments.

By the end of the course, the students are expected to have acquired a thorough understanding of the following concepts:

- Compilers, build system toolchains and HPC environments;
- Parallel and distributed programming models;
- Parallel and distributed profiling tools;
- Data visulization methodology for performance benchmarking;
- Memory and data structure layout optimizations;
- Distributed programming optimizations;
- Shared-memory parallelism optimizations;
- CPU microarchitecture: vectorization, unrolling and ILP optimizations.
